<h1>LA M&Egrave;RE BAUCHE.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pyreneean valley in which the
baths of Vernet are situated is not much known to English, or
indeed to any travellers.&nbsp; Tourists in search of good hotels
and picturesque beauty combined, do not generally extend their
journeys to the Eastern Pyrenees.&nbsp; They rarely get beyond
Luchon; and in this they are right, as they thus end their
peregrinations at the most lovely spot among these mountains, and
are as a rule so deceived, imposed on, and bewildered by guides,
innkeepers, and horse-owners, at this otherwise delightful place,
as to become undesirous of further travel.&nbsp; Nor do invalids
from distant parts frequent Vernet.&nbsp; People of fashion go to
the Eaux Bonnes and to Luchon, and people who are really ill to
Bar&eacute;ges and Cauterets.&nbsp; It is at these places that
one meets crowds of Parisians, and the daughters and wives of
rich merchants from Bordeaux, with an admixture, now by no means
inconsiderable, of Englishmen and Englishwomen.&nbsp; But the
Eastern Pyrenees are still unfrequented.&nbsp; And probably they
will remain so; for though there are among them lovely
valleys&mdash;and of all such the valley of Vernet is perhaps the
most lovely&mdash;they cannot compete with the mountain scenery
of other tourists-loved regions in Europe.&nbsp; At the Port de
Venasquez and the Br&egrave;che de Roland in the Western
Pyrenees, or rather, to speak more truly, at spots in the close
vicinity of these famous mountain entrances from France into
Spain, one can make comparisons with Switzerland, Northern Italy,
the Tyrol, and Ireland, which will not be injurious to the scenes
then under view.&nbsp; But among the eastern mountains this can
rarely be done.&nbsp; The hills do not stand thickly together so
as to group themselves; the passes from one valley to another,
though not wanting in altitude, are not close pressed together
with overhanging rocks, and are deficient in grandeur as well as
loveliness.&nbsp; And then, as a natural consequence of all this,
the hotels&mdash;are not quite as good as they should be.</p>
<p>But there is one mountain among them which can claim to rank
with the P&iacute;c du Midi or the Maledetta.&nbsp; No one can
pooh-pooh the stern old Canigou, standing high and solitary,
solemn and grand, between the two roads which run from Perpignan
into Spain, the one by Prades and the other by Le Boulon.&nbsp;
Under the Canigou, towards the west, lie the hot baths of Vernet,
in a close secluded valley, which, as I have said before, is, as
far as I know, the sweetest spot in these Eastern Pyrenees.</p>
<p>The frequenters of these baths were a few years back gathered
almost entirely from towns not very far distant, from Perpignan,
Narbonne, Carcassonne, and B&eacute;zi&egrave;res, and the baths
were not therefore famous, expensive, or luxurious; but those who
believed in them believed with great faith; and it was certainly
the fact that men and women who went thither worn with toil, sick
with excesses, and nervous through over-care, came back fresh and
strong, fit once more to attack the world with all its
woes.&nbsp; Their character in latter days does not seem to have
changed, though their circle of admirers may perhaps be somewhat
extended.</p>
<p>In those days, by far the most noted and illustrious person in
the village of Vernet was La M&egrave;re Bauche.&nbsp; That there
had once been a P&egrave;re Bauche was known to the world, for
there was a Fils Bauche who lived with his mother; but no one
seemed to remember more of him than that he had once
existed.&nbsp; At Vernet he had never been known.&nbsp; La
M&egrave;re Bauche was a native of the village, but her married
life had been passed away from it, and she had returned in her
early widowhood to become proprietress and manager, or, as one
may say, the heart and soul of the H&ocirc;tel Bauche at
Vernet.</p>
<p>This hotel was a large and somewhat rough establishment,
intended for the accommodation of invalids who came to Vernet for
their health.&nbsp; It was built immediately over one of the
thermal springs, so that the water flowed from the bowels of the
earth directly into the baths.&nbsp; There was accommodation for
seventy people, and during the summer and autumn months the place
was always full.&nbsp; Not a few also were to be found there
during the winter and spring, for the charges of Madame Bauche
were low, and the accommodation reasonably good.</p>
<p>And in this respect, as indeed in all others, Madame Bauche
had the reputation of being an honest woman.&nbsp; She had a
certain price, from which no earthly consideration would induce
her to depart; and there were certain returns for this price in
the shape of d&eacute;jeuners and dinners, baths and beds, which
she never failed to give in accordance with the dictates of a
strict conscience.&nbsp; These were traits in the character of an
hotel-keeper which cannot be praised too highly, and which had
met their due reward in the custom of the public.&nbsp; But
nevertheless there were those who thought that there was
occasionally ground for complaint in the conduct even of Madame
Bauche.</p>
<p>In the first place she was deficient in that pleasant smiling
softness which should belong to any keeper of a house of public
entertainment.&nbsp; In her general mode of life she was stern
and silent with her guests, autocratic, authoritative and
sometimes contradictory in her house, and altogether irrational
and unconciliatory when any change even for a day was proposed to
her, or when any shadow of a complaint reached her ears.</p>
<p>Indeed of complaint, as made against the establishment, she
was altogether intolerant.&nbsp; To such she had but one
answer.&nbsp; He or she who complained might leave the place at a
moment&rsquo;s notice if it so pleased them.&nbsp; There were
always others ready to take their places.&nbsp; The power of
making this answer came to her from the lowness of her prices;
and it was a power which was very dear to her.</p>
<p>The baths were taken at different hours according to medical
advice, but the usual time was from five to seven in the
morning.&nbsp; The d&eacute;jeuner or early meal was at nine
o&rsquo;clock, the dinner was at four.&nbsp; After that, no
eating or drinking was allowed in the H&ocirc;tel Bauche.&nbsp;
There was a caf&eacute; in the village, at which ladies and
gentlemen could get a cup of coffee or a glass of eau
sucr&eacute;; but no such accommodation was to be had in the
establishment.&nbsp; Not by any possible bribery or persuasion
could any meal be procured at any other than the authorised
hours.&nbsp; A visitor who should enter the salle &agrave; manger
more than ten minutes after the last bell would be looked at very
sourly by Madame Bauche, who on all occasions sat at the top of
her own table.&nbsp; Should any one appear as much as half an
hour late, he would receive only his share of what had not been
handed round.&nbsp; But after the last dish had been so handed,
it was utterly useless for any one to enter the room at all.</p>
<p>Her appearance at the period of our tale was perhaps not
altogether in her favour.&nbsp; She was about sixty years of age
and was very stout and short in the neck.&nbsp; She wore her own
gray hair, which at dinner was always tidy enough; but during the
whole day previous to that hour she might be seen with it
escaping from under her cap in extreme disorder.&nbsp; Her
eyebrows were large and bushy, but those alone would not have
given to her face that look of indomitable sternness which it
possessed.&nbsp; Her eyebrows were serious in their effect, but
not so serious as the pair of green spectacles which she always
wore under them.&nbsp; It was thought by those who had analysed
the subject that the great secret of Madame Bauche&rsquo;s power
lay in her green spectacles.</p>
<p>Her custom was to move about and through the whole
establishment every day from breakfast till the period came for
her to dress for dinner.&nbsp; She would visit every chamber and
every bath, walk once or twice round the salle &agrave; manger,
and very repeatedly round the kitchen; she would go into every
hole and corner, and peer into everything through her green
spectacles: and in these walks it was not always thought pleasant
to meet her.&nbsp; Her custom was to move very slowly, with her
hands generally clasped behind her back: she rarely spoke to the
guests unless she was spoken to, and on such occasions she would
not often diverge into general conversation.&nbsp; If any one had
aught to say connected with the business of the establishment,
she would listen, and then she would make her
answers,&mdash;often not pleasant in the hearing.</p>
<p>And thus she walked her path through the world, a stern, hard,
solemn old woman, not without gusts of passionate explosion; but
honest withal, and not without some inward benevolence and true
tenderness of heart.&nbsp; Children she had had many, some seven
or eight.&nbsp; One or two had died, others had been married; she
had sons settled far away from home, and at the time of which we
are now speaking but one was left in any way subject to maternal
authority.</p>
<p>Adolphe Bauche was the only one of her children of whom much
was remembered by the present denizens and hangers-on of the
hotel, he was the youngest of the number, and having been born
only very shortly before the return of Madame Bauche to Vernet,
had been altogether reared there.&nbsp; It was thought by the
world of those parts, and rightly thought, that he was his
mother&rsquo;s darling&mdash;more so than had been any of his
brothers and sisters,&mdash;the very apple of her eye and gem of
her life.&nbsp; At this time he was about twenty-five years of
age, and for the last two years had been absent from
Vernet&mdash;for reasons which will shortly be made to
appear.&nbsp; He had been sent to Paris to see something of the
world, and learn to talk French instead of the patois of his
valley; and having left Paris had come down south into Languedoc,
and remained there picking up some agricultural lore which it was
thought might prove useful in the valley farms of Vernet.&nbsp;
He was now expected home again very speedily, much to his
mother&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<p>That she was kind and gracious to her favourite child does not
perhaps give much proof of her benevolence; but she had also been
kind and gracious to the orphan child of a neighbour; nay, to the
orphan child of a rival innkeeper.&nbsp; At Vernet there had been
more than one water establishment, but the proprietor of the
second had died some few years after Madame Bauche had settled
herself at the place.&nbsp; His house had not thrived, and his
only child, a little girl, was left altogether without
provision.</p>
<p>This little girl, Marie Clavert, La M&egrave;re Bauche had
taken into her own house immediately after the father&rsquo;s
death, although she had most cordially hated that father.&nbsp;
Marie was then an infant, and Madame Bauche had accepted the
charge without much thought, perhaps, as to what might be the
child&rsquo;s ultimate destiny.&nbsp; But since then she had
thoroughly done the duty of a mother by the little girl, who had
become the pet of the whole establishment, the favourite
plaything of Adolphe Bauche, and at last of course his early
sweetheart.</p>
<p>And then and therefore there had come troubles at
Vernet.&nbsp; Of course all the world of the valley had seen what
was taking place and what was likely to take place, long before
Madame Bauche knew anything about it.&nbsp; But at last it broke
upon her senses that her son, Adolphe Bauche, the heir to all her
virtues and all her riches, the first young man in that or any
neighbouring valley, was absolutely contemplating the idea of
marrying that poor little orphan, Marie Clavert!</p>
<p>That any one should ever fall in love with Marie Clavert had
never occurred to Madame Bauche.&nbsp; She had always regarded
the child as a child, as the object of her charity, and as a
little thing to be looked on as poor Marie by all the
world.&nbsp; She, looking through her green spectacles, had never
seen that Marie Clavert was a beautiful creature, full of
ripening charms, such as young men love to look on.&nbsp; Marie
was of infinite daily use to Madame Bauche in a hundred little
things about the house, and the old lady thoroughly recognised
and appreciated her ability.&nbsp; But for this very reason she
had never taught herself to regard Marie otherwise than as a
useful drudge.&nbsp; She was very fond of her
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&mdash;so much so that she would listen to
her in affairs about the house when she would listen to no one
else;&mdash;but Marie&rsquo;s prettiness and grace and sweetness
as a girl had all been thrown away upon Maman Bauche, as Marie
used to call her.</p>
<p>But unluckily it had not been thrown away upon Adolphe.&nbsp;
He had appreciated, as it was natural that he should do, all that
had been so utterly indifferent to his mother; and consequently
had fallen in love.&nbsp; Consequently also he had told his love;
and consequently also Marie had returned his love.</p>
<p>Adolphe had been hitherto contradicted but in few things, and
thought that all difficulty would be prevented by his informing
his mother that he wished to marry Marie Clavert.&nbsp; But
Marie, with a woman&rsquo;s instinct, had known better.&nbsp; She
had trembled and almost crouched with fear when she confessed her
love; and had absolutely hid herself from sight when Adolphe went
forth, prepared to ask his mother&rsquo;s consent to his
marriage.</p>
<p>The indignation and passionate wrath of Madame Bauche were
past and gone two years before the date of this story, and I need
not therefore much enlarge upon that subject.&nbsp; She was at
first abusive and bitter, which was bad for Marie; and afterwards
bitter and silent, which was worse.&nbsp; It was of course
determined that poor Marie should be sent away to some asylum for
orphans or penniless paupers&mdash;in short anywhere out of the
way.&nbsp; What mattered her outlook into the world, her
happiness, or indeed her very existence?&nbsp; The outlook and
happiness of Adolphe Bauche,&mdash;was not that to be considered
as everything at Vernet?</p>
<p>But this terrible sharp aspect of affairs did not last very
long.&nbsp; In the first place La M&egrave;re Bauche had under
those green spectacles a heart that in truth was tender and
affectionate, and after the first two days of anger she admitted
that something must be done for Marie Clavert; and after the
fourth day she acknowledged that the world of the hotel, her
world, would not go as well without Marie Clavert as it would
with her.&nbsp; And in the next place Madame Bauche had a friend
whose advice in grave matters she would sometimes take.&nbsp;
This friend had told her that it would be much better to send
away Adolphe, since it was so necessary that there should be a
sending away of some one; that he would be much benefited by
passing some months of his life away from his native valley; and
that an absence of a year or two would teach him to forget Marie,
even if it did not teach Marie to forget him.</p>
<p>And we must say a word or two about this friend.&nbsp; At
Vernet he was usually called M. le Capitaine, though in fact he
had never reached that rank.&nbsp; He had been in the army, and
having been wounded in the leg while still a sous-lieutenant, had
been pensioned, and had thus been interdicted from treading any
further the thorny path that leads to glory.&nbsp; For the last
fifteen years he had resided under the roof of Madame Bauche, at
first as a casual visitor, going and coming, but now for many
years as constant there as she was herself.</p>
<p>He was so constantly called Le Capitaine that his real name
was seldom heard.&nbsp; It may however as well be known to us
that this was Theodore Campan.&nbsp; He was a tall, well-looking
man; always dressed in black garments, of a coarse description
certainly, but scrupulously clean and well brushed; of perhaps
fifty years of age, and conspicuous for the rigid uprightness of
his back&mdash;and for a black wooden leg.</p>
<p>This wooden leg was perhaps the most remarkable trait in his
character.&nbsp; It was always jet black, being painted, or
polished, or japanned, as occasion might require, by the hands of
the capitaine himself.&nbsp; It was longer than ordinary wooden
legs, as indeed the capitaine was longer than ordinary men; but
nevertheless it never seemed in any way to impede the rigid
punctilious propriety of his movements.&nbsp; It was never in his
way as wooden legs usually are in the way of their wearers.&nbsp;
And then to render it more illustrious it had round its middle,
round the calf of the leg we may so say, a band of bright brass
which shone like burnished gold.</p>
<p>It had been the capitaine&rsquo;s custom, now for some years
past, to retire every evening at about seven o&rsquo;clock into
the sanctum sanctorum of Madame Bauche&rsquo;s habitation, the
dark little private sitting-room in which she made out her bills
and calculated her profits, and there regale himself in her
presence&mdash;and indeed at her expense, for the items never
appeared in the bill&mdash;with coffee and cognac.&nbsp; I have
said that there was never eating or drinking at the establishment
after the regular dinner-hours; but in so saying I spoke of the
world at large.&nbsp; Nothing further was allowed in the way of
trade; but in the way of friendship so much was now-a-days always
allowed to the capitaine.</p>
<p>It was at these moments that Madame Bauche discussed her
private affairs, and asked for and received advice.&nbsp; For
even Madame Bauche was mortal; nor could her green spectacles
without other aid carry her through all the troubles of
life.&nbsp; It was now five years since the world of Vernet
discovered that La M&egrave;re Bauche was going to marry the
capitaine; and for eighteen months the world of Vernet had been
full of this matter: but any amount of patience is at last
exhausted, and as no further steps in that direction were ever
taken beyond the daily cup of coffee, that subject died
away&mdash;very much unheeded by La M&egrave;re Bauche.</p>
<p>But she, though she thought of no matrimony for herself,
thought much of matrimony for other people; and over most of
those cups of evening coffee and cognac a matrimonial project was
discussed in these latter days.&nbsp; It has been seen that the
capitaine pleaded in Marie&rsquo;s favour when the fury of Madame
Bauche&rsquo;s indignation broke forth; and that ultimately Marie
was kept at home, and Adolphe sent away by his advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Adolphe cannot always stay away,&rdquo; Madame
Bauche had pleaded in her difficulty.&nbsp; The truth of this the
capitaine had admitted; but Marie, he said, might be married to
some one else before two years were over.&nbsp; And so the matter
had commenced.</p>
<p>But to whom should she be married?&nbsp; To this question the
capitaine had answered in perfect innocence of heart, that La
M&egrave;re Bauche would be much better able to make such a
choice than himself.&nbsp; He did not know how Marie might stand
with regard to money.&nbsp; If madame would give some little
&ldquo;dot,&rdquo; the affair, the capitaine thought, would be
more easily arranged.</p>
<p>All these things took months to say, during which period Marie
went on with her work in melancholy listlessness.&nbsp; One
comfort she had.&nbsp; Adolphe, before he went, had promised to
her, holding in his hand as he did so a little cross which she
had given him, that no earthly consideration should sever
them;&mdash;that sooner or later he would certainly be her
husband.&nbsp; Marie felt that her limbs could not work nor her
tongue speak were it not for this one drop of water in her
cup.</p>
<p>And then, deeply meditating, La M&egrave;re Bauche hit upon a
plan, and herself communicated it to the capitaine over a second
cup of coffee into which she poured a full teaspoonful more than
the usual allowance of cognac.&nbsp; Why should not he, the
capitaine himself, be the man to marry Marie Clavert?</p>
<p>It was a very startling proposal, the idea of matrimony for
himself never having as yet entered into the capitaine&rsquo;s
head at any period of his life; but La M&egrave;re Bauche did
contrive to make it not altogether unacceptable.&nbsp; As to that
matter of dowry she was prepared to be more than generous.&nbsp;
She did love Marie well, and could find it in her heart to give
her anything&mdash;any thing except her son, her own
Adolphe.&nbsp; What she proposed was this.&nbsp; Adolphe,
himself, would never keep the baths.&nbsp; If the capitaine would
take Marie for his wife, Marie, Madame Bauche declared, should be
the mistress after her death; subject of course to certain
settlements as to Adolphe&rsquo;s pecuniary interests.</p>
<p>The plan was discussed a thousand times, and at last so far
brought to bear that Marie was made acquainted with
it&mdash;having been called in to sit in presence with La
M&egrave;re Bauche and her future proposed husband.&nbsp; The
poor girl manifested no disgust to the stiff ungainly lover whom
they assigned to her,&mdash;who through his whole frame was in
appearance almost as wooden as his own leg.&nbsp; On the whole,
indeed, Marie liked the capitaine, and felt that he was her
friend; and in her country such marriages were not
uncommon.&nbsp; The capitaine was perhaps a little beyond the age
at which a man might usually be thought justified in demanding
the services of a young girl as his nurse and wife, but then
Marie of herself had so little to give&mdash;except her youth,
and beauty, and goodness.</p>
<p>But yet she could not absolutely consent; for was she not
absolutely pledged to her own Adolphe?&nbsp; And therefore, when
the great pecuniary advantages were, one by one, displayed before
her, and when La M&egrave;re Bauche, as a last argument, informed
her that as wife of the capitaine she would be regarded as second
mistress in the establishment and not as a servant, she could
only burst out into tears, and say that she did not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be very kind to you,&rdquo; said the capitaine;
&ldquo;as kind as a man can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie took his hard withered hand and kissed it; and then
looked up into his face with beseeching eyes which were not
without avail upon his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not press her now,&rdquo; said the
capitaine.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is time enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But let his heart be touched ever so much, one thing was
certain.&nbsp; It could not be permitted that she should marry
Adolphe.&nbsp; To that view of the matter he had given in his
unrestricted adhesion; nor could he by any means withdraw it
without losing altogether his position in the establishment of
Madame Bauche.&nbsp; Nor indeed did his conscience tell him that
such a marriage should be permitted.&nbsp; That would be too
much.&nbsp; If every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first
young man that might fall in love with her, what would the world
come to?</p>
<p>And it soon appeared that there was not time enough&mdash;that
the time was growing very scant.&nbsp; In three months Adolphe
would be back.&nbsp; And if everything was not arranged by that
time, matters might still go astray.</p>
<p>And then Madame Bauche asked her final question: &ldquo;You do
not think, do you, that you can ever marry Adolphe?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as she asked it the accustomed terror of her green spectacles
magnified itself tenfold.&nbsp; Marie could only answer by
another burst of tears.</p>
<p>The affair was at last settled among them.&nbsp; Marie said
that she would consent to marry the capitaine when she should
hear from Adolphe&rsquo;s own mouth that he, Adolphe, loved her
no longer.&nbsp; She declared with many tears that her vows and
pledges prevented her from promising more than this.&nbsp; It was
not her fault, at any rate not now, that she loved her
lover.&nbsp; It was not her fault&mdash;not now at
least&mdash;that she was bound by these pledges.&nbsp; When she
heard from his own mouth that he had discarded her, then she
would marry the capitaine&mdash;or indeed sacrifice herself in
any other way that La M&egrave;re Bauche might desire.&nbsp; What
would anything signify then?</p>
<p>Madame Bauche&rsquo;s spectacles remained unmoved; but not her
heart.&nbsp; Marie, she told the capitaine, should be equal to
herself in the establishment, when once she was entitled to be
called Madame Campan, and she should be to her quite as a
daughter.&nbsp; She should have her cup of coffee every evening,
and dine at the big table, and wear a silk gown at church, and
the servants should all call her Madame; a great career should be
open to her, if she would only give up her foolish girlish
childish love for Adolphe.&nbsp; And all these great promises
were repeated to Marie by the capitaine.</p>
<p>But nevertheless there was but one thing in the world which in
Marie&rsquo;s eyes was of any value; and that one thing was the
heart of Adolphe Bauche.&nbsp; Without that she would be nothing;
with that,&mdash;with that assured, she could wait patiently till
doomsday.</p>
<p>Letters were written to Adolphe during all these eventful
doings; and a letter came from him saying that he greatly valued
Marie&rsquo;s love, but that as it had been clearly proved to him
that their marriage would be neither for her advantage, nor for
his, he was willing to give it up.&nbsp; He consented to her
marriage with the capitaine, and expressed his gratitude to his
mother for the pecuniary advantages which she had held out to
him.&nbsp; Oh, Adolphe, Adolphe!&nbsp; But, alas, alas! is not
such the way of most men&rsquo;s hearts&mdash;and of the hearts
of some women?</p>
<p>This letter was read to Marie, but it had no more effect upon
her than would have had some dry legal document.&nbsp; In those
days and in those places men and women did not depend much upon
letters; nor when they were written, was there expressed in them
much of heart or of feeling.&nbsp; Marie would understand, as she
was well aware, the glance of Adolphe&rsquo;s eye and the tone of
Adolphe&rsquo;s voice; she would perceive at once from them what
her lover really meant, what he wished, what in the innermost
corner of his heart he really desired that she should do.&nbsp;
But from that stiff constrained written document she could
understand nothing.</p>
<p>It was agreed therefore that Adolphe should return, and that
she would accept her fate from his mouth.&nbsp; The capitaine,
who knew more of human nature than poor Marie, felt tolerably
sure of his bride.&nbsp; Adolphe, who had seen something of the
world, would not care very much for the girl of his own
valley.&nbsp; Money and pleasure, and some little position in the
world, would soon wean him from his love; and then Marie would
accept her destiny&mdash;as other girls in the same position had
done since the French world began.</p>
<p>And now it was the evening before Adolphe&rsquo;s expected
arrival.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re Bauche was discussing the matter
with the capitaine over the usual cup of coffee.&nbsp; Madame
Bauche had of late become rather nervous on the matter, thinking
that they had been somewhat rash in acceding so much to
Marie.&nbsp; It seemed to her that it was absolutely now left to
the two young lovers to say whether or no they would have each
other or not.&nbsp; Now nothing on earth could be further from
Madame Bauche&rsquo;s intention than this.&nbsp; Her decree and
resolve was to heap down blessings on all persons
concerned&mdash;provided always that she could have her own way;
but, provided she did not have her own way, to heap
down,&mdash;anything but blessings.&nbsp; She had her code of
morality in this matter.&nbsp; She would do good if possible to
everybody around her.&nbsp; But she would not on any score be
induced to consent that Adolphe should marry Marie Clavert.&nbsp;
Should that be in the wind she would rid the house of Marie, of
the capitaine, and even of Adolphe himself.</p>
<p>She had become therefore somewhat querulous, and
self-opinionated in her discussions with her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said on the evening in
question; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It may be all right;
but if Adolphe turns against me, what are we to do
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&egrave;re Bauche,&rdquo; said the capitaine, sipping
his coffee and puffing out the smoke of his cigar, &ldquo;Adolphe
will not turn against us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had been somewhat
remarked by many that the capitaine was more at home in the
house, and somewhat freer in his manner of talking with Madame
Bauche, since this matrimonial alliance had been on the tapis
than he had ever been before.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re herself
observed it, and did not quite like it; but how could she prevent
it now?&nbsp; When the capitaine was once married she would make
him know his place, in spite of all her promises to Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he says he likes the girl?&rdquo; continued
Madame Bauche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, you may be sure that he will say nothing of
the kind.&nbsp; He has not been away two years without seeing
girls as pretty as Marie.&nbsp; And then you have his
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing, capitaine; he would eat his letter as
quick as you would eat an omelet aux fines herbes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the capitaine was especially quick over an omelet aux
fines herbes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, M&egrave;re Bauche, you also have the purse; he
will know that he cannot eat that, except with your good
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Bauche, &ldquo;poor
lad!&nbsp; He has not a sous in the world unless I give it to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it did not seem that this reflection was in
itself displeasing to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adolphe will now be a man of the world,&rdquo;
continued the capitaine.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will know that it does
not do to throw away everything for a pair of red lips.&nbsp;
That is the folly of a boy, and Adolphe will be no longer a
boy.&nbsp; Believe me, M&egrave;re Bauche, things will be right
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we shall have Marie sick and ill and half
dying on our hands,&rdquo; said Madame Bauche.</p>
<p>This was not flattering to the capitaine, and so he felt
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps so, perhaps not,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But at any rate she will get over it.&nbsp; It is a malady
which rarely kills young women&mdash;especially when another
alliance awaits them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Madame Bauche; and in saying that word
she avenged herself for the too great liberty which the capitaine
had lately taken.&nbsp; He shrugged his shoulders, took a pinch
of snuff and uninvited helped himself to a teaspoonful of
cognac.&nbsp; Then the conference ended, and on the next morning
before breakfast Adolphe Bauche arrived.</p>
<p>On that morning poor Marie hardly knew how to bear
herself.&nbsp; A month or two back, and even up to the last day
or two, she had felt a sort of confidence that Adolphe would be
true to her; but the nearer came that fatal day the less strong
was the confidence of the poor girl.&nbsp; She knew that those
two long-headed, aged counsellors were plotting against her
happiness, and she felt that she could hardly dare hope for
success with such terrible foes opposed to her.&nbsp; On the
evening before the day Madame Bauche had met her in the passages,
and kissed her as she wished her good night.&nbsp; Marie knew
little about sacrifices, but she felt that it was a sacrificial
kiss.</p>
<p>In those days a sort of diligence with the mails for Olette
passed through Prades early in the morning, and a conveyance was
sent from Vernet to bring Adolphe to the baths.&nbsp; Never was
prince or princess expected with more anxiety.&nbsp; Madame
Bauche was up and dressed long before the hour, and was heard to
say five several times that she was sure he would not come.&nbsp;
The capitaine was out and on the high road, moving about with his
wooden leg, as perpendicular as a lamp-post and almost as
black.&nbsp; Marie also was up, but nobody had seen her.&nbsp;
She was up and had been out about the place before any of them
were stirring; but now that the world was on the move she lay
hidden like a hare in its form.</p>
<p>And then the old char-&agrave;-banc clattered up to the door,
and Adolphe jumped out of it into his mother&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;
He was fatter and fairer than she had last seen him, had a larger
beard, was more fashionably clothed, and certainly looked more
like a man.&nbsp; Marie also saw him out of her little window,
and she thought that he looked like a god.&nbsp; Was it probable,
she said to herself, that one so godlike would still care for
her?</p>
<p>The mother was delighted with her son, who rattled away quite
at his ease.&nbsp; He shook hands very cordially with the
capitaine&mdash;of whose intended alliance with his own
sweetheart he had been informed, and then as he entered the house
with his hand under his mother&rsquo;s arm, he asked one question
about her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where is Marie?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Marie! oh upstairs; you shall see her after
breakfast,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re Bauche.&nbsp; And so they
entered the house, and went in to breakfast among the
guests.&nbsp; Everybody had heard something of the story, and
they were all on the alert to see the young man whose love or
want of love was considered to be of so much importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see that it will be all right,&rdquo; said the
capitaine, carrying his head very high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, I think so,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re
Bauche, who, now that the capitaine was right, no longer desired
to contradict him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that it will be all right,&rdquo; said the
capitaine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you that Adolphe would return a
man; and he is a man.&nbsp; Look at him; he does not care this
for Marie Clavert;&rdquo; and the capitaine, with much eloquence
in his motion, pitched over a neighbouring wall a small stone
which he held in his hand.</p>
<p>And then they all went to breakfast with many signs of outward
joy.&nbsp; And not without some inward joy; for Madame Bauche
thought she saw that her son was cured of his love.&nbsp; In the
mean time Marie sat up stairs still afraid to show herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has come,&rdquo; said a young girl, a servant in the
house, running up to the door of Marie&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marie; &ldquo;I could see that he has
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, oh, how beautiful he is!&rdquo; said the girl,
putting her hands together and looking up to the ceiling.&nbsp;
Marie in her heart of hearts wished that he was not half so
beautiful, as then her chance of having him might be greater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the company are all talking to him as though he
were the pr&eacute;fet,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind who is talking to him,&rdquo; said Marie;
&ldquo;go away, and leave me&mdash;you are wanted for your
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why before this was he not talking to
her?&nbsp; Why not, if he were really true to her?&nbsp; Alas, it
began to fall upon her mind that he would be false!&nbsp; And
what then?&nbsp; What should she do then?&nbsp; She sat still
gloomily, thinking of that other spouse that had been promised to
her.</p>
<p>As speedily after breakfast as was possible Adolphe was
invited to a conference in his mother&rsquo;s private room.&nbsp;
She had much debated in her own mind whether the capitaine should
be invited to this conference or no.&nbsp; For many reasons she
would have wished to exclude him.&nbsp; She did not like to teach
her son that she was unable to manage her own affairs, and she
would have been well pleased to make the capitaine understand
that his assistance was not absolutely necessary to her.&nbsp;
But then she had an inward fear that her green spectacles would
not now be as efficacious on Adolphe, as they had once been, in
old days, before he had seen the world and become a man.&nbsp; It
might be necessary that her son, being a man, should be opposed
by a man.&nbsp; So the capitaine was invited to the
conference.</p>
<p>What took place there need not be described at length.&nbsp;
The three were closeted for two hours, at the end of which time
they came forth together.&nbsp; The countenance of Madame Bauche
was serene and comfortable; her hopes of ultimate success ran
higher than ever.&nbsp; The face of the capitaine was masked, as
are always the faces of great diplomatists; he walked placid and
upright, raising his wooden leg with an ease and skill that was
absolutely marvellous.&nbsp; But poor Adolphe&rsquo;s brow was
clouded.&nbsp; Yes, poor Adolphe! for he was poor in spirit, he
had pledged himself to give up Marie, and to accept the liberal
allowance which his mother tendered him; but it remained for him
now to communicate these tidings to Marie herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not you tell her?&rdquo; he had said to his
mother, with very little of that manliness in his face on which
his mother now so prided herself.&nbsp; But La M&egrave;re Bauche
explained to him that it was a part of the general agreement that
Marie was to hear his decision from his own mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you need not regard it,&rdquo; said the capitaine,
with the most indifferent air in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;The girl
expects it.&nbsp; Only she has some childish idea that she is
bound till you yourself release her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
she will be troublesome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adolphe at that moment did
feel that he should have liked to kick the capitaine out of his
mother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And where should the meeting take place?&nbsp; In the hall of
the bath-house, suggested Madame Bauche; because, as she
observed, they could walk round and round, and nobody ever went
there at that time of day.&nbsp; But to this Adolphe objected; it
would be so cold and dismal and melancholy.</p>
<p>The capitaine thought that M&egrave;re Bauche&rsquo;s little
parlour was the place; but La M&egrave;re herself did not like
this.&nbsp; They might be overheard, as she well knew; and she
guessed that the meeting would not conclude without some sobs
that would certainly be bitter and might perhaps be loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her up to the grotto, and I will follow
her,&rdquo; said Adolphe.&nbsp; On this therefore they
agreed.&nbsp; Now the grotto was a natural excavation in a high
rock, which stood precipitously upright over the establishment of
the baths.&nbsp; A steep zigzag path with almost never-ending
steps had been made along the face of the rock from a little
flower garden attached to the house which lay immediately under
the mountain.&nbsp; Close along the front of the hotel ran a
little brawling river, leaving barely room for a road between it
and the door; over this there was a wooden bridge leading to the
garden, and some two or three hundred yards from the bridge began
the steps by which the ascent was made to the grotto.</p>
<p>When the season was full and the weather perfectly warm the
place was much frequented.&nbsp; There was a green table in it,
and four or five deal chairs; a green garden seat also was there,
which however had been removed into the innermost back corner of
the excavation, as its hinder legs were somewhat at fault.&nbsp;
A wall about two feet high ran along the face of it, guarding its
occupants from the precipice.&nbsp; In fact it was no grotto, but
a little chasm in the rock, such as we often see up above our
heads in rocky valleys, and which by means of these steep steps
had been turned into a source of exercise and amusement for the
visitors at the hotel.</p>
<p>Standing at the wall one could look down into the garden, and
down also upon the shining slate roof of Madame Bauche&rsquo;s
house; and to the left might be seen the sombre, silent,
snow-capped top of stern old Canigou, king of mountains among
those Eastern Pyrenees.</p>
<p>And so Madame Bauche undertook to send Marie up to the grotto,
and Adolphe undertook to follow her thither.&nbsp; It was now
spring; and though the winds had fallen and the snow was no
longer lying on the lower peaks, still the air was fresh and
cold, and there was no danger that any of the few guests at the
establishment would visit the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make her put on her cloak, M&egrave;re Bauche,&rdquo;
said the capitaine, who did not wish that his bride should have a
cold in her head on their wedding-day.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re
Bauche pished and pshawed, as though she were not minded to pay
any attention to recommendations on such subjects from the
capitaine.&nbsp; But nevertheless when Marie was seen slowly to
creep across the little bridge about fifteen minutes after this
time, she had a handkerchief on her head, and was closely wrapped
in a dark brown cloak.</p>
<p>Poor Marie herself little heeded the cold fresh air, but she
was glad to avail herself of any means by which she might hide
her face.&nbsp; When Madame Bauche sought her out in her own
little room, and with a smiling face and kind kiss bade her go to
the grotto, she knew, or fancied that she knew that it was all
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will tell you all the truth,&mdash;how it all
is,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will do all we
can, you know, to make you happy, Marie.&nbsp; But you must
remember what Monsieur le Cur&eacute; told us the other
day.&nbsp; In this vale of tears we cannot have everything; as we
shall have some day, when our poor wicked souls have been purged
of all their wickedness.&nbsp; Now go, dear, and take your
cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Adolphe will come to you.&nbsp; And try and behave
well, like a sensible girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maman,&rdquo;&mdash;and so she went, bearing on
her brow another sacrificial kiss&mdash;and bearing in her heart
such an unutterable load of woe!</p>
<p>Adolphe had gone out of the house before her; but standing in
the stable yard, well within the gate so that she should not see
him, he watched her slowly crossing the bridge and mounting the
first flight of the steps.&nbsp; He had often seen her tripping
up those stairs, and had, almost as often, followed her with his
quicker feet.&nbsp; And she, when she would hear him, would run;
and then he would catch her breathless at the top, and steal
kisses from her when all power of refusing them had been robbed
from her by her efforts at escape.&nbsp; There was no such
running now, no such following, no thought of such kisses.</p>
<p>As for him, he would fain have skulked off and shirked the
interview had he dared.&nbsp; But he did not dare; so he waited
there, out of heart, for some ten minutes, speaking a word now
and then to the bath-man, who was standing by, just to show that
he was at his ease.&nbsp; But the bath-man knew that he was not
at his ease.&nbsp; Such would-be lies as those rarely achieve
deception;&mdash;are rarely believed.&nbsp; And then, at the end
of the ten minutes, with steps as slow as Marie&rsquo;s had been,
he also ascended to the grotto.</p>
<p>Marie had watched him from the top, but so that she herself
should not be seen.&nbsp; He however had not once lifted up his
head to look for her; but with eyes turned to the ground had
plodded his way up to the cave.&nbsp; When he entered she was
standing in the middle, with her eyes downcast and her hands
clasped before her.&nbsp; She had retired some way from the wall,
so that no eyes might possibly see her but those of her false
lover.&nbsp; There she stood when he entered, striving to stand
motionless, but trembling like a leaf in every limb.</p>
<p>It was only when he reached the top step that he made up his
mind how he would behave.&nbsp; Perhaps after all, the capitaine
was right; perhaps she would not mind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said he, with a voice that attempted to
be cheerful; &ldquo;this is an odd place to meet in after such a
long absence,&rdquo; and he held out his hand to her.&nbsp; But
only his hand!&nbsp; He offered her no salute.&nbsp; He did not
even kiss her cheek as a brother would have done!&nbsp; Of the
rules of the outside world it must be remembered that poor Marie
knew but little.&nbsp; He had been a brother to her before he had
become her lover.</p>
<p>But Marie took his hand saying, &ldquo;Yes, it has been very
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that I have come back,&rdquo; he went on to
say, &ldquo;it seems that we are all in a confusion
together.&nbsp; I never knew such a piece of work.&nbsp; However,
it is all for the best, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Marie, still trembling
violently, and still looking upon the ground.&nbsp; And then
there was silence between them for a minute or so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Marie,&rdquo; said Adolphe at
last, dropping her hand and making a great effort to get through
the work before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid we two have been
very foolish.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think we have now?&nbsp; It
seems quite clear that we can never get ourselves married.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you see it in that light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s head turned round and round with her, but she
was not of the fainting order.&nbsp; She took three steps
backwards and leant against the wall of the cave.&nbsp; She also
was trying to think how she might best fight her battle.&nbsp;
Was there no chance for her?&nbsp; Could no eloquence, no love
prevail?&nbsp; On her own beauty she counted but little; but
might not prayers do something, and a reference to those old vows
which had been so frequent, so eager, so solemnly pledged between
them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never get ourselves married!&rdquo; she said, repeating
his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never, Adolphe?&nbsp; Can we never be
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, my dear girl, I fear not.&nbsp; You see
my mother is so dead against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we could wait; could we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that&rsquo;s just it, Marie.&nbsp; We cannot
wait.&nbsp; We must decide now,&mdash;to-day.&nbsp; You see I can
do nothing without money from her&mdash;and as for you, you see
she won&rsquo;t even let you stay in the house unless you marry
old Campan at once.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a very good sort of fellow
though, old as he is.&nbsp; And if you do marry him, why you see
you&rsquo;ll stay here, and have it all your own way in
everything.&nbsp; As for me, I shall come and see you all from
time to time, and shall be able to push my way as I ought to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Adolphe, you wish me to marry the
capitaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour I think it is the best thing you can do;
I do indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Adolphe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, you know?&nbsp; Suppose I was to
go down to my mother and tell her that I had decided to keep you
myself; what would come of it?&nbsp; Look at it in that light,
Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could not turn you out&mdash;you her own
son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she would turn you out; and deuced quick, too, I
can assure you of that; I can, upon my honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not care that,&rdquo; and she made a motion
with her hand to show how indifferent she would be to such
treatment as regarded herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that&mdash;; if I
still had the promise of your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would work.&nbsp; There are other houses beside that
one,&rdquo; and she pointed to the slate roof of the Bauche
establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for me&mdash;I should not have a penny in the
world,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>She came up to him and took his right hand between both of
hers and pressed it warmly, oh, so warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would
have my love,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;my deepest, warmest best
heart&rsquo;s love should want nothing more, nothing on earth, if
I could still have yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she leaned against his
shoulder and looked with all her eyes into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marie, that&rsquo;s nonsense, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Adolphe, it is not nonsense.&nbsp; Do not let them
teach you so.&nbsp; What does love mean, if it does not mean
that?&nbsp; Oh, Adolphe, you do love me, you do love me, you do
love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;&mdash;I love you,&rdquo; he said slowly;&mdash;as
though he would not have said it, if he could have helped
it.&nbsp; And then his arm crept slowly round her waist, as
though in that also he could not help himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do not I love you?&rdquo; said the passionate
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I do, so dearly; with all my heart, with
all my soul.&nbsp; Adolphe, I so love you, that I cannot give you
up.&nbsp; Have I not sworn to be yours; sworn, sworn a thousand
times?&nbsp; How can I marry that man!&nbsp; Oh Adolphe how can
you wish that I should marry him?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she clung to
him, and looked at him, and besought him with her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wish it;&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo; and
then he paused.&nbsp; It was hard to tell her that he was willing
to sacrifice her to the old man because he wanted money from his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what!&nbsp; But Adolphe, do not wish it at
all!&nbsp; Have you not sworn that I should be your wife?&nbsp;
Look here, look at this;&rdquo; and she brought out from her
bosom a little charm that he had given her in return for that
cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you not kiss that when you swore before
the figure of the Virgin that I should be your wife?&nbsp; And do
you not remember that I feared to swear too, because your mother
was so angry; and then you made me?&nbsp; After that,
Adolphe!&nbsp; Oh, Adolphe!&nbsp; Tell me that I may have some
hope.&nbsp; I will wait; oh, I will wait so patiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned himself away from her and walked backwards and
forwards uneasily through the grotto.&nbsp; He did love
her;&mdash;love her as such men do love sweet, pretty
girls.&nbsp; The warmth of her hand, the affection of her touch,
the pure bright passion of her tear-laden eye had re-awakened
what power of love there was within him.&nbsp; But what was he to
do?&nbsp; Even if he were willing to give up the immediate golden
hopes which his mother held out to him, how was he to begin, and
then how carry out this work of self-devotion?&nbsp; Marie would
be turned away, and he would be left a victim in the hands of his
mother, and of that stiff, wooden-legged militaire;&mdash;a
penniless victim, left to mope about the place without a grain of
influence or a morsel of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can we do?&rdquo; he exclaimed again, as he
once more met Marie&rsquo;s searching eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can be true and honest, and we can wait,&rdquo; she
said, coming close up to him and taking hold of his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not fear it; and she is not my mother, Adolphe.&nbsp;
You need not fear your own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear! no, of course I don&rsquo;t fear.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t see how the very devil we can manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me tell her that I will not marry the
capitaine; that I will not give up your promises; and then I am
ready to leave the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would do no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would do every good, Adolphe, if I had your promised
word once more; if I could hear from your own voice one more tone
of love.&nbsp; Do you not remember this place?&nbsp; It was here
that you forced me to say that I loved you.&nbsp; It is here also
that you will tell me that I have been deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I that would deceive you,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder that you should be so hard upon
me.&nbsp; God knows that I have trouble enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I am a trouble to you, be it so.&nbsp; Be it
as you wish,&rdquo; and she leaned back against the wall of the
rock, and crossing her arms upon her breast looked away from him
and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of Canigou.</p>
<p>He again betook himself to walk backwards and forwards through
the cave.&nbsp; He had quite enough of love for her to make him
wish to marry her; quite enough now, at this moment, to make the
idea of her marriage with the capitaine very distasteful to him;
enough probably to make him become a decently good husband to
her, should fate enable him to marry her; but not enough to
enable him to support all the punishment which would be the sure
effects of his mother&rsquo;s displeasure.&nbsp; Besides, he had
promised his mother that he would give up Marie;&mdash;had
entirely given in his adhesion to that plan of the marriage with
the capitaine.&nbsp; He had owned that the path of life as marked
out for him by his mother was the one which it behoved him, as a
man, to follow.&nbsp; It was this view of his duties as a man
which had I been specially urged on him with all the
capitaine&rsquo;s eloquence.&nbsp; And old Campan had entirely
succeeded.&nbsp; It is so easy to get the assent of such young
men, so weak in mind and so weak in pocket, when the arguments
are backed by a promise of two thousand francs a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; at last
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my mother by herself, and
will ask her to let the matter remain as it is for the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it be a trouble, M. Adolphe;&rdquo; and the
proud girl still held her hands upon her bosom, and still looked
towards the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, Marie.&nbsp; You can understand
how she and the capitaine are worrying me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Adolphe, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I love you, only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will not give me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask my mother.&nbsp; I will try and make her
yield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie could not feel that she received much confidence from
her lover&rsquo;s promise; but still, even that, weak and
unsteady as it was, even that was better than absolute fixed
rejection.&nbsp; So she thanked him, promised him with tears in
her eyes that she would always, always be faithful to him, and
then bade him go down to the house.&nbsp; She would follow, she
said, as soon as his passing had ceased to be observed.</p>
<p>Then she looked at him as though she expected some sign of
renewed love.&nbsp; But no such sign was vouchsafed to her.&nbsp;
Now that she thirsted for the touch of his lip upon her check, it
was denied to her.&nbsp; He did as she bade him; he went down,
slowly loitering, by himself; and in about half an hour she
followed him, and unobserved crept to her chamber.</p>
<p>Again we will pass over what took place between the mother and
the son; but late in that evening, after the guests had gone to
bed, Marie received a message, desiring her to wait on Madame
Bauche in a small salon which looked out from one end of the
house.&nbsp; It was intended as a private sitting-room should any
special stranger arrive who required such accommodation, and
therefore was but seldom used.&nbsp; Here she found La
M&egrave;re Bauche sitting in an arm-chair behind a small table
on which stood two candles; and on a sofa against the wall sat
Adolphe.&nbsp; The capitaine was not in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the door, Marie, and come in and sit down,&rdquo;
said Madame Bauche.&nbsp; It was easy to understand from the tone
of her voice that she was angry and stern, in an unbending mood,
and resolved to carry out to the very letter all the threats
conveyed by those terrible spectacles.</p>
<p>Marie did as she was bid.&nbsp; She closed the door and sat
down on the chair that was nearest to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re Bauche&mdash;and the
voice sounded fierce in the poor girl&rsquo;s ears, and an angry
fire glimmered through the green glasses&mdash;&ldquo;what is all
this about that I hear?&nbsp; Do you dare to say that you hold my
son bound to marry you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the august mother
paused for an answer.</p>
<p>But Marie had no answer to give.&nbsp; See looked suppliantly
towards her lover, as though beseeching him to carry on the fight
for her.&nbsp; But if she could not do battle for herself,
certainly he could not do it for her.&nbsp; What little amount of
fighting he had had in him, had been thoroughly vanquished before
her arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have an answer, and that immediately,&rdquo;
said Madame Bauche.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not going to be betrayed
into ignominy and disgrace by the object of my own charity.&nbsp;
Who picked you out of the gutter, miss, and brought you up and
fed you, when you would otherwise have gone to the
foundling?&nbsp; And this is your gratitude for it all?&nbsp; You
are not satisfied with being fed and clothed and cherished by me,
but you must rob me of my son!&nbsp; Know this then, Adolphe
shall never marry a child of charity such as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie sat still, stunned by the harshness of these
words.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re Bauche had often scolded her; indeed,
she was given to much scolding; but she had scolded her as a
mother may scold a child.&nbsp; And when this story of
Marie&rsquo;s love first reached her ears, she had been very
angry; but her anger had never brought her to such a pass as
this.&nbsp; Indeed, Marie had not hitherto been taught to look at
the matter in this light.&nbsp; No one had heretofore twitted her
with eating the bread of charity.&nbsp; It had not occurred to
her that on this account she was unfit to be Adolphe&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; There, in that valley, they were all so nearly equal,
that no idea of her own inferiority had ever pressed itself upon
her mind.&nbsp; But now&mdash;!</p>
<p>When the voice ceased she again looked at him; but it was no
longer a beseeching look.&nbsp; Did he also altogether scorn
her?&nbsp; That was now the inquiry which her eyes were called
upon to make.&nbsp; No; she could not say that he did.&nbsp; It
seemed to her that his energies were chiefly occupied in pulling
to pieces the tassel on the sofa cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, miss, let me know at once whether this
nonsense is to be over or not,&rdquo; continued La M&egrave;re
Bauche; &ldquo;and I will tell you at once, I am not going to
maintain you here, in my house, to plot against our welfare and
happiness.&nbsp; As Marie Clavert you shall not stay here.&nbsp;
Capitaine Campan is willing to marry you; and as his wife I will
keep my word to you, though you little deserve it.&nbsp; If you
refuse to marry him, you must go.&nbsp; As to my son, he is
there; and he will tell you now, in my presence, that he
altogether declines the honour you propose for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she ceased, waiting for an answer, drumming the table
with a wafer stamp which happened to be ready to her hand; but
Marie said nothing.&nbsp; Adolphe had been appealed to; but
Adolphe had not yet spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, miss?&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re Bauche</p>
<p>Then Marie rose from her seat, and walking round she touched
Adolphe lightly on the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Adolphe,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it is for you to speak now.&nbsp; I will do as you
bid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a long sigh, looked first at Marie and then at his
mother, shook himself slightly, and then spoke: &ldquo;Upon my
word, Marie, I think mother is right.&nbsp; It would never do for
us to marry; it would not indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is decided,&rdquo; said Marie, returning to her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will marry the capitaine?&rdquo; said La
M&egrave;re Bauche.</p>
<p>Marie merely bowed her head in token of acquiescence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then we are friends again.&nbsp; Come here, Marie, and
kiss me.&nbsp; You must know that it is my duty to take care of
my own son.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t want to be angry with you if
I can help it; I don&rsquo;t indeed.&nbsp; When once you are
Madame Campan, you shall be my own child; and you shall have any
room in the house you like to choose&mdash;there!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she once more imprinted a kiss on Marie&rsquo;s cold
forehead.</p>
<p>How they all got out of the room, and off to their own
chambers, I can hardly tell.&nbsp; But in five minutes from the
time of this last kiss they were divided.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re
Bauche had patted Marie, and smiled on her, and called her her
dear good little Madame Campan, her young little Mistress of the
H&ocirc;tel Bauche; and had then got herself into her own room,
satisfied with her own victory.</p>
<p>Nor must my readers be too severe on Madame Bauche.&nbsp; She
had already done much for Marie Clavert; and when she found
herself once more by her own bedside, she prayed to be forgiven
for the cruelty which she felt that she had shown to the
orphan.&nbsp; But in making this prayer, with her favourite
crucifix in her hand and the little image of the Virgin before
her, she pleaded her duty to her son.&nbsp; Was it not right, she
asked the Virgin, that she should save her son from a bad
marriage?&nbsp; And then she promised ever so much of recompense,
both to the Virgin and to Marie; a new trousseau for each, with
candles to the Virgin, with a gold watch and chain for Marie, as
soon as she should be Marie Campan.&nbsp; She had been cruel; she
acknowledged it.&nbsp; But at such a crisis was it not
defensible?&nbsp; And then the recompense should be so full!</p>
<p>But there was one other meeting that night, very short indeed,
but not the less significant.&nbsp; Not long after they had all
separated, just so long as to allow of the house being quiet,
Adolphe, still sitting in his room, meditating on what the day
had done for him, heard a low tap at his door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; he said, as men always do say; and Marie opening the
door, stood just within the verge of his chamber.&nbsp; She had
on her countenance neither the soft look of entreating love which
she had worn up there in the grotto, nor did she appear crushed
and subdued as she had done before his mother.&nbsp; She carried
her head somewhat more erect than usual, and looked boldly out at
him from under her soft eyelashes.&nbsp; There might still be
love there, but it was love proudly resolving to quell
itself.&nbsp; Adolphe, as he looked at her, felt that he was
afraid of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all over then between us, M. Adolphe?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it had better be
so, eh, Marie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the meaning of oaths and vows, sworn to
each other so sacredly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marie, you heard what my mother said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&nbsp; I have not come to ask you again to love
me.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; I am not thinking of that.&nbsp; But this,
this would be a lie if I kept it now; it would choke me if I wore
it as that man&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Take it back;&rdquo; and she
tendered to him the little charm which she had always worn round
her neck since he had given it to her.&nbsp; He took it
abstractedly, without thinking what he did, and placed it on his
dressing-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;can you still
keep that cross?&nbsp; Oh, no! you must give me back that.&nbsp;
It would remind you too often of vows that were
untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not be so harsh to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harsh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;no; there has been
enough of harshness.&nbsp; I would not be harsh to you,
Adolphe.&nbsp; But give me the cross; it would prove a curse to
you if you kept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then opened a little box which stood upon the table, and
taking out the cross gave it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now good-bye,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
shall have but little more to say to each other.&nbsp; I know
this now, that I was wrong ever to have loved you.&nbsp; I should
have been to you as one of the other poor girls in the
house.&nbsp; But, oh! how was I to help it?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
he made no answer, and she, closing the door softly, went back to
her chamber.&nbsp; And thus ended the first day of Adolphe
Bauche&rsquo;s return to his own house.</p>
<p>On the next morning the capitaine and Marie were formally
betrothed.&nbsp; This was done with some little ceremony, in the
presence of all the guests who were staying at the establishment,
and with all manner of gracious acknowledgments of Marie&rsquo;s
virtues.&nbsp; It seemed as though La M&egrave;re Bauche could
not be courteous enough to her.&nbsp; There was no more talk of
her being a child of charity; no more allusion now to the
gutter.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re Bauche with her own hand brought her
cake with a glass of wine after her betrothal was over, and
patted her on the cheek, and called her her dear little Marie
Campan.&nbsp; And then the capitaine was made up of infinite
politeness, and the guests all wished her joy, and the servants
of the house began to perceive that she was a person entitled to
respect.&nbsp; How different was all this from that harsh attack
that was made on her the preceding evening!&nbsp; Only
Adolphe,&mdash;he alone kept aloof.&nbsp; Though he was present
there he said nothing.&nbsp; He, and he only, offered no
congratulations.</p>
<p>In the midst of all these gala doings Marie herself said
little or nothing.&nbsp; La M&egrave;re Bauche perceived this,
but she forgave it.&nbsp; Angrily as she had expressed herself at
the idea of Marie&rsquo;s daring to love her son, she had still
acknowledged within her own heart that such love had been
natural.&nbsp; She could feel no pity for Marie as long as
Adolphe was in danger; but now she knew how to pity her.&nbsp; So
Marie was still petted and still encouraged, though she went
through the day&rsquo;s work sullenly and in silence.</p>
<p>As to the capitaine it was all one to him.&nbsp; He was a man
of the world.&nbsp; He did not expect that he should really be
preferred, con amore, to a young fellow like Adolphe.&nbsp; But
he did expect that Marie, like other girls, would do as she was
bid; and that in a few days she would regain her temper and be
reconciled to her life.</p>
<p>And then the marriage was fixed for a very early day; for as
La M&egrave;re said, &ldquo;What was the use of waiting?&nbsp;
All their minds were made up now, and therefore the sooner the
two were married the better.&nbsp; Did not the capitaine think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capitaine said that he did think so.</p>
<p>And then Marie was asked.&nbsp; It was all one to her, she
said.&nbsp; Whatever Maman Bauche liked, that she would do; only
she would not name a day herself.&nbsp; Indeed she would neither
do nor say anything herself which tended in any way to a
furtherance of these matrimonials.&nbsp; But then she acquiesced,
quietly enough if not readily, in what other people did and said;
and so the marriage was fixed for the day week after
Adolphe&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>The whole of that week passed much in the same way.&nbsp; The
servants about the place spoke among themselves of Marie&rsquo;s
perverseness, obstinacy, and ingratitude, because she would not
look pleased, or answer Madame Bauche&rsquo;s courtesies with
gratitude; but La M&egrave;re herself showed no signs of
anger.&nbsp; Marie had yielded to her, and she required no
more.&nbsp; And she remembered also the harsh words she had used
to gain her purpose; and she reflected on all that Marie had
lost.&nbsp; On these accounts she was forbearing and exacted
nothing&mdash;nothing but that one sacrifice which was to be made
in accordance to her wishes.</p>
<p>And it was made.&nbsp; They were married in the great salon,
the dining-room, immediately after breakfast.&nbsp; Madame Bauche
was dressed in a new puce silk dress, and looked very magnificent
on the occasion.&nbsp; She simpered and smiled, and looked gay
even in spite of her spectacles; and as the ceremony was being
performed, she held fast clutched in her hand the gold watch and
chain which were intended for Marie as soon as ever the marriage
should be completed.</p>
<p>The capitaine was dressed exactly as usual, only that all his
clothes were new.&nbsp; Madame Bauche had endeavoured to persuade
him to wear a blue coat; but he answered that such a change would
not, he was sure, be to Marie&rsquo;s taste.&nbsp; To tell the
truth, Marie would hardly have known the difference had he
presented himself in scarlet vestments.</p>
<p>Adolphe, however, was dressed very finely, but he did not make
himself prominent on the occasion.&nbsp; Marie watched him
closely, though none saw that she did so; and of his garments she
could have given an account with much accuracy&mdash;of his
garments, ay! and of every look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he a man,&rdquo;
she said at last to herself, &ldquo;that he can stand by and see
all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She too was dressed in silk.&nbsp; They had put on her what
they pleased, and she bore the burden of her wedding finery
without complaint and without pride.&nbsp; There was no blush on
her face as she walked up to the table at which the priest stood,
nor hesitation in her low voice as she made the necessary
answers.&nbsp; She put her hand into that of the capitaine when
required to do so; and when the ring was put on her finger she
shuddered, but ever so slightly.&nbsp; No one observed it but La
M&egrave;re Bauche.&nbsp; &ldquo;In one week she will be used to
it, and then we shall all be happy,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I,&mdash;I will be so kind to
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the marriage was completed, and the watch was at once
given to Marie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, maman,&rdquo; said she,
as the trinket was fastened to her girdle.&nbsp; Had it been a
pincushion that had cost three sous, it would have affected her
as much.</p>
<p>And then there was cake and wine and sweetmeats; and after a
few minutes Marie disappeared.&nbsp; For an hour or so the
capitaine was taken up with the congratulating of his friends,
and with the efforts necessary to the wearing of his new honours
with an air of ease; but after that time he began to be uneasy
because his wife did not come to him.&nbsp; At two or three in
the afternoon he went to La M&egrave;re Bauche to complain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This lackadaisical nonsense is no good,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate it is too late now.&nbsp; Marie
had better come down among us and show herself satisfied with her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madame Bauche took Marie&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must not be too hard on Marie,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
has gone through a good deal this week past, and is very young;
whereas, capitaine, you are not very young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capitaine merely shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; In the mean
time M&egrave;re Bauche went up to visit her
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e in her own room, and came down with a
report that she was suffering from a headache.&nbsp; She could
not appear at dinner, Madame Bauche said; but would make one at
the little party which was to be given in the evening.&nbsp; With
this the capitaine was forced to be content.</p>
<p>The dinner therefore went on quietly without her, much as it
did on other ordinary days.&nbsp; And then there was a little
time for vacancy, during which the gentlemen drank their coffee
and smoked their cigars at the caf&eacute;, talking over the
event that had taken place that morning, and the ladies brushed
their hair and added some ribbon or some brooch to their usual
apparel.&nbsp; Twice during this time did Madame Bauche go up to
Marie&rsquo;s room with offers to assist her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
yet, maman; not quite yet,&rdquo; said Marie piteously through
her tears, and then twice did the green spectacles leave the
room, covering eyes which also were not dry.&nbsp; Ah! what had
she done?&nbsp; What had she dared to take upon herself to
do?&nbsp; She could not undo it now.</p>
<p>And then it became quite dark in the passages and out of
doors, and the guests assembled in the salon.&nbsp; La
M&egrave;re came in and out three or four times, uneasy in her
gait and unpleasant in her aspect, and everybody began to see
that things were wrong.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is ill, I am
afraid,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;The excitement has been too
much,&rdquo; said a second; &ldquo;and he is so old,&rdquo;
whispered a third.&nbsp; And the capitaine stalked about erect on
his wooden leg, taking snuff, and striving to look indifferent;
but he also was uneasy in his mind.</p>
<p>Presently La M&egrave;re came in again, with a quicker step
than before, and whispered something, first to Adolphe and then
to the capitaine, whereupon they both followed her out of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in her chamber,&rdquo; said Adolphe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must be in yours,&rdquo; said the
capitaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in neither,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re Bauche,
with her sternest voice; &ldquo;nor is she in the
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now there was no longer an affectation of indifference on
the part of any of them.&nbsp; They were anything but
indifferent.&nbsp; The capitaine was eager in his demands that
the matter should still be kept secret from the guests.&nbsp; She
had always been romantic, he said, and had now gone out to walk
by the river side.&nbsp; They three and the old bath-man would go
out and look for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is pitch dark,&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re
Bauche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take lanterns,&rdquo; said the capitaine.&nbsp;
And so they sallied forth with creeping steps over the gravel, so
that they might not be heard by those within, and proceeded to
search for the young wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie!&nbsp; Marie!&rdquo; said La M&egrave;re Bauche,
in piteous accents; &ldquo;do come to me; pray do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the capitaine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hear you if you call.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could
not endure that the world should learn that a marriage with him
had been so distasteful to Marie Clavert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie, dear Marie!&rdquo; called Madame Bauche, louder
than before, quite regardless of the capitaine&rsquo;s feelings;
but no Marie answered.&nbsp; In her innermost heart now did La
M&egrave;re Bauche wish that this cruel marriage had been left
undone.</p>
<p>Adolphe was foremost with his lamp, but he hardly dared to
look in the spot where he felt that it was most likely that she
should have taken refuge.&nbsp; How could he meet her again,
alone, in that grotto?&nbsp; Yet he alone of the four was
young.&nbsp; It was clearly for him to ascend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;are you there?&rdquo; as
he slowly began the long ascent of the steps.</p>
<p>But he had hardly begun to mount when a whirring sound struck
his ear, and he felt that the air near him was moved; and then
there was a crash upon the lower platform of rock, and a moan,
repeated twice, but so faintly, and a rustle of silk, and a
slight struggle somewhere as he knew within twenty paces of him;
and then all was again quiet and still in the night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked the capitaine in a hoarse
voice.&nbsp; He made his way half across the little garden, and
he also was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock.&nbsp;
But Adolphe was unable to answer him.&nbsp; He had fainted and
the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled to the bottom of
the steps.</p>
<p>But the capitaine, though even his heart was all but quenched
within him, had still strength enough to make his way up to the
rock; and there, holding the lantern above his eyes, he saw all
that was left for him to see of his bride.</p>
<p>As for La M&egrave;re Bauche, she never again sat at the head
of that table,&mdash;never again dictated to guests,&mdash;never
again laid down laws for the management of any one.&nbsp; A poor
bedridden old woman, she lay there in her house at Vernet for
some seven tedious years, and then was gathered to her
fathers.</p>
<p>As for the capitaine&mdash;but what matters?&nbsp; He was made
of sterner stuff.&nbsp; What matters either the fate of such a
one as Adolphe Bauche?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
